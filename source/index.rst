Welcome to CAcert code documentation's documentation!
=====================================================

This is a work in progress documentation of the CAcert web application source
code at https://git.cacert.org/gitweb/?p=cacert.git.

The goal is to document the existing code base to give insight into its
functionality and to support writing a specification for a potential
reimplementation.
